# MinecraftDragon

In our Java class, we are working with mods and plugins for Minecraft.  The goal is to collaborate and learn Java through this project.

The ultimate goal is to have the EnderDragon drop 5 dragon scales when killed.  The dragon scales can be used to make dragon armor that also is an elytra.

Successful changes so far:
on enable plugin, make players glow and unable to move
command to restore health
onSneak, glow
onSneak, send up fireworks
